# PyBer_Analysis
Delivering Results:

##1st Pragraph
The purpose of this assignment was to analyze key metrics for Pyber by city type, including: total rides, drivers, fares, average fair per ride, and average fare per driver. I analyzed the data by merging the two CSV files given and using the groupby() function to count and sum up requested metrics. I used simple mathematic equations for Average fare per ride and Average fare per driver and then formatted into a single dataframe. 
It is very clear in the summary DataFrame that the city type ‘Urban’ has quite a lot more total rides, drivers and fares than those of Suburban or Rural communities. In the Multiple-Line graph, it similarly shows that the gold line “urban” is at the top of the chart with total fares way higher than the other two city types.
