# PyBer_Analysis
## Intro Paragraph
The purpose of this assignment was to analyze key metrics for Pyber by city type, including: total rides, drivers, fares, average fair per ride, and average fare per driver. I analyzed the data by merging the two CSV files given and using the groupby() function to count and sum up requested metrics. I used simple mathematic equations for Average fare per ride and Average fare per driver and then formatted into a single dataframe. 
It is very clear in the summary DataFrame that the city type ‘Urban’ has quite a lot more total rides, drivers and fares than those of Suburban or Rural communities. In the Multiple-Line graph, it similarly shows that the gold line “urban” is at the top of the chart with total fares way higher than the other two city types.

In Summary, Ubran cities are much more bustling and happening! There are more people needing more rides, which also increases the number of drivers and total fares. The average fare per ride and fare per driver for Urban are less than Suburban and Rural.
